Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are models that utilize deep learning methods to generate images by cleverly converting the problem into a supervised learning task. A GAN consists of two models: the Generator and the Discriminator. These two models are trained simultaneously through an adversarial process, where the Generator ("the artist") learns to create images that resemble those in the dataset, and the Discriminator ("the art critic") learns to distinguish between real and fake images.

During the training process, the Generator gradually improves its ability to generate realistic images, while the Discriminator continuously enhances its capability to differentiate real images from generated ones. The Generator takes a random noise vector as input and transforms it into a high-dimensional image through a series of transposed convolutional layers. The Discriminator, on the other hand, takes an image as input, extracts features through convolutional layers, and outputs the probability of the image being real.

The training process is a minimax optimization problem. First, the Discriminator's parameters are updated using both real and generated images so that it can better distinguish between real and generated images. Then, the Generator's parameters are updated using the Discriminator's feedback on the generated images, so that the Generator can produce more realistic images.

Training reaches a balance when the images generated by the Generator look real enough that the Discriminator cannot easily tell them apart from real images. Ultimately, GANs can produce high-quality artistic portraits, with the Generator and Discriminator improving together through their adversarial relationship.

The beautiful GAN model works by artist Karnika Kapoor (https://www.kaggle.com/code/karnikakapoor/art-by-gan) inspired me, and I aimed to use her model as a reference to enhance the number of training iterations and address the issue of insufficient data. Thus, I primarily optimized:

Increasing data, preprocessing data, and data augmentation to expand the dataset and improve the model's generalization ability.
Modifying the latent dimension to latent_dim = 128, setting the dimension of the latent space.
Optimizing the structure of the Generator's model by increasing the dimensions of its convolutional layers, thereby increasing the model's parameter count to enable it to learn more information. The Generator's model structure was referenced from (https://www.kaggle.com/code/micheledifazio/abstract-art-gan).
